## Part 2: The Rules

### Rule 1: Work Deeply

**Eudaimonia Machine**: A conceptual building where one passes through a series of rooms with not return or shortcuts (no hallways).
  - 1st Room: a gallery meant to inspire you, with examples of other deep work already done there
  - 2nd Room: a salon with a coffee machine with couches and wifi, to help one mull over the idea. A place to debate and "brood"
  - 3rd Room: a library, details on the previous work done there, as well as other resources such as books, copiers, scanners.
  - 4th Room: an office, to do the 'shallow' work of ones project, and get organised
  - 5th Room: small chambers with soundproofing for total focus and uninterrupted work

The **strategies** that follow will help me simulate its [Eudaimonia Machine] effects in my otherwise distracted professional life. They’ll show me how to **transform deep work from an aspiration into a regular and significant part** of my daily schedule.

Rules **#2 through #4** will then help me get the most out of this deep work habit **by presenting strategies** for
  - training my concentration ability and
  - fighting back encroaching distractions.

*Do we really need something as complicated as the Eudaimonia Machine for something as simple as remembering to concentrate more often?*

Unfortunately, **when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters are not so simple.**

One of the main obstacles to going deep: **the urge to turn my attention toward something more superficial**. This urge can complicate efforts to concentrate on hard things, but most underestimate its regularity and strength.

  - Ones **will is like a muscle* that tires, **not** a manifestation of my character that I can deploy without limit.
  - One must move beyond good intentions
  - Add routines and rituals to my working life

The key to developing a deep work habit is to minimize the amount of my limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

One can't simply switch our attention to a cognitively difficult task in the middle of a distracted afternoon. This would draw a lot of energy from the aforementioned willpower. This approach is doomed to failure.

#### Decide on my Depth Philosophy

 - Monastic: complete retreat from all distractions and other people, hermit style! Eliminiate/minimise shallow obligations.
 - Bimodal: cut myself off from the world at regular intervals, perhaps a few days each week. These people will admire the productivity of the monastics but also respect the value they receive from the shallow behaviors in their working lives. 
 - Rhythmic: generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for me to invest energy in deciding if and when I'm going to go deep. Probably the best one for me as it fits in with a regular work schedule, and removes the cathartic need to decide what to do all the time.
 - Journalistic: Like a journalist, go at it whenever I have a free moment.
 
 #### Ritualise
 
_"Charles Darwin had a similarly strict structure for his working life during the period when he was perfecting On the Origin of Species. As his son Francis later remembered, he would rise promptly at seven to take a short walk. He would then eat breakfast alone and retire to his study from eight to nine thirty. The next hour was dedicated to reading his letters from the day before, after which he would return to his study from ten thirty until noon. After this session, he would mull over challenging ideas while walking on a proscribed route that started at his greenhouse and then circled a path on his property. He would walk until satisfied with his thinking then declare his workday done."_

There’s no one correct deep work ritual, it depends on both the person and type of project. Some general questions that any effective ritual must address:

1. Where I’ll work and for how long
   1. Ritual needs to specify a location, which can be as simple as the office with the door shut and desk cleaned off.
   1. Give myself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.
1. How I’ll work once I start to work
   1. ritual needs rules and processes to keep my efforts structured, e.g. a ban on internet.
   1. Without this structure, I’ll have unnecessary drains on my willpower reserves to
      1. mentally litigate again and again what I should and should not be doing during these sessions 
      1. keep trying to assess whether I'm working sufficiently hard.
1. How I’ll support my work
   1. ritual needs to ensure my brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. E.g. ritual might specify that I
      1. start with a cup of good coffee
      1. have access to enough food of the right type to maintain energy
      1. integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear
   1. support needs to be systematized so that I don’t waste mental energy figuring out what I need in the moment

To work deeply is a big deal and should not be an activity undertaken lightly. Surrounding such efforts with a complicated ritual accepts this reality and provides my mind with the structure and commitment it needs to slip into the state of deep focus where I can begin to create things that matter.

#### Make Grand Gestures

E.g. book yourself into a an expensive hotel such as the Balmoral in Edinburgh like J.K. Rowling did for HP and the Deathly Hallows.

Many writers [...] simulate the experience year-round by building writing cabins on their properties. These outbuildings aren’t strictly necessary for these writers [...]. But it’s not the amenities of the cabins that generate their value; it’s instead the grand gesture represented in the design and building of the cabin for the sole purpose of enabling better writing. - The plan, design and build of such an outbuilding would in itself be a good project for deep work.

#### Don't Work Alone

Newport suggests that working professionally with another invidividual can promote such deep work, in effect short-circuiting the natural instinct to avoid depth. An elaborate analogy was drawn with Bell Labs' Building 20 at MIT. Such an environment is not accessible to most people, however parallels can be drawn to pair programming in software development, where I myself have found that the propensity to get distracted is greatly reduced. As Newport summarise at the end of this section, distraction is the destroyer of depth.

#### Execute Like a Business

The division between what and how [to do something] is crucial but is overlooked in the professional world.

What follows is Newport's adaptation of an existing framework called 4DX towards the goal of developing a deep work habit.

##### Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important

##### Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures

##### Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

##### Discipline #4: Crete a Cadence of Accountability
